## What is Hugin?

Hugin is a security proxy built for bug bounty hunters and penetration testers. It gives you everything you need to start hunting on day 1 — free, with no account required.

**Community (free, forever):**
- MITM Proxy (HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, WebSocket)
- Active Scanner (43 checks: SSRF, SQLi, SSTI, XSS, JWT, LDAP, BOLA, path traversal, smuggling, and more)
- Passive Scanner
- Intruder (fuzzer with payload generators, processors, grep matching)
- Repeater
- Sequencer, Decoder, Comparer, Site Map
- Scriptable UI automation (navigate views, select flows, switch panes, highlight, screenshot — all from MCP)
- 128 MCP tools (connect Claude, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible AI agent)

**Pro (5 EUR/month — for everyone):**
- Race condition engine (60+ modules, single-packet, last-byte sync)
- Synaps WASM modules (community scanner modules, sandboxed)
- Lua extensions (modify live traffic with scripts)
- E2E encrypted real-time collaboration
- Multi-project workspaces
- 56 offensive vurl MCP tools (HTTP smuggling, deserialization, SSRF chains, WAF evasion, AI agent exploitation, and more)

No subscriptions. No auto-renewal. Pay when you need it.
Researcher, pentester, hacker — we don't differentiate. Everyone's welcome.
